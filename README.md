# Neighborhood App - Front End
### [Deployed on Netlify](https://neighbourhood-back.herokuapp.com/)

The Hood is a web application that provides a platform for residents of various neighbourhoods to interact with each other, and keep abreast of current activities in their neighbourhoods.

## Back-end

This repo hosts the front-end side of the application that is built in Angular. The app has a back-end that is deployed separately. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/SharonFaith/neighbourhood-backend).

## Installation

To run the app locally on your Ubuntu computer, simply clone this repo. For this you will first need to install Git.

```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/VictorKMaina/Neighbourhood.git
```

To run the application you will also need to install Angular and npm. You can find instructions for this [here](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).

## Usage

Once you have installed Angular, you can use the Angular CLI to run the application on a local server.

```
ng serve
```
